# Todo App

A modern and intuitive Todo App built with a focus on productivity, simplicity, and clean design. This application allows users to efficiently manage daily tasks, track progress, and prioritize their work with ease.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Todos:** Easily create new tasks, update them, or remove them when completed.
- **Task Completion Tracking:** Mark tasks as complete or incomplete to organize your workflow.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Persistent Storage:** Todos are saved locally so your data persists even after refreshing.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and modern UI for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** [React.js] (or your framework/library, update accordingly)
- **Styling:** CSS3 / TailwindCSS / Bootstrap (update as per your implementation)
- **State Management:** useState, useEffect (or Redux/Context API, if used)
- **Other Tools:** (List any additional libraries used, e.g., Axios, React Router, etc.)

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sonupandit9693/Todo-app.git
cd Todo-app
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Why This Project Stands Out

- Showcases my understanding of modern JavaScript frameworks and best UI/UX practices.
- Built with clean, maintainable, and modular code.
- Demonstrates my ability to deliver a full-featured, real-world application from scratch.
